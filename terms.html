    <h1>Real Travelling Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Real Travelling is owned by Gap 360 Ltd, a UK Limited Liability company whose registered office is at 30 City Rd,
      London, EC1Y 2AB, and whose trading office is at 121/123 Mt Pleasant Rd, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TN1 1QR. All
      correspondence should be directed to the Tunbridge Wells booking office.

    </p>
    <p>Part of the ethos of our organization is to treat everyone fairly. For you, our customer, this means that we are
      committed to dealing honestly and openly with you every step of the way, from the moment you book with us, to the
      time you return home from your trip.

    </p>
    <p>To start with we want to ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of your booking. We know that
      you are often presented with long detailed legal terms and conditions when you purchase items online and many
      people simply tick the box agreeing to the terms without bothering to read them, but you really do need to read
      and understand our terms.

    </p>
    <p>We have done our best to make these booking terms easy to understand, and they are very important as they are the
      basis for your booking with Gap 360 Ltd. As part of the booking process, you must acknowledge in writing that you
      agree to them and the trip is sold to you subject to these terms and conditions.

    </p>
    <p>In the following booking terms and conditions, "we", "us" and "our" refer to Real Travelling.

    </p>
    <p>"You" and "your" refer to the customer whose name appears on the booking and for whom the trip is being arranged;
      "trip" includes all the arrangements we put in place for you overseas.

    </p>
    <p>Real Travelling is abbreviated to RT in the terms below.
    </p><br>


    <h1>Financial Security</h1>

      </P>
      <P>3.Flight inclusive packages that commence outside of the UK, which are sold to customers outside the UK.
      </P>
    </div>
    <P>1, 2 and 3 provides for a refund in the event you have not yet travelled. 1 and 3 provides for repatriation.

      Travelling.
    </P>
    <br><br>


    <h1>Booking, payments, changes to bookings, cancellations, amendments, price changes</h1>

    <p>
    <div style="margin-left:30px;">1.You can book with us by telephone, online, or in person. Bookings should be made by
      the person travelling, and you must be 18 or over to make a booking. Your booking must be made in the exact way
      your name appears in your passport and all personal details must be correct. You can book with travelling
      companion(s), but they should complete their own booking details and sign that they accept the terms and
      conditions. If you do book on behalf of someone else you must have their permission to share their accurate and up
      to date personal details with Real Travelling and confirm that you are agreeing to our terms and conditions on
      their behalf. You must check your confirmation and online account details carefully and report any incorrect or
      incomplete information to us immediately.
      </p>


      <p>2. When you book a place on most trips you have the following options with regards to deposits and payments:
      </p>
      <p>
      <div style="margin-left:30px;">*<strong> Normal Plan:</strong> Pay a deposit of £199 per programme booked, and
        then pay the balance of the trip fee 12 weeks (84 days) before departure. You can pay the booking deposit by
        credit or debit card or by BACs transfer. Deposits are non refundable, and not transferable. However in the
        event that your trip choice or dates become unavailable for any reason, we will refund your deposit or transfer
        it to another trip of your choice.
        </p>
        <p>*<strong> Payment Plan:</strong> Pay just £49 at time of booking, and make equal monthly payments starting
          from the first month following your booking and your last payment is to be made one full calendar month prior
          to departure. The deposit payment must be paid on a debit or credit card, and then we'll provide you with a
          standing order form for your bank. Payment plan does not apply for trips departing within 84 days of booking.
          The first two payment instalments and deposit are non refundable. However in the event that your trip choice
          of dates becomes unavailable for any reason, we will refund your payments or transfer them to another trip.
        </p>
        <p>* <strong>Pay in full:</strong> You can pay for your trip in full at the time of booking by credit or debit
          card or by BACs transfer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>3. Certain other trips require a different deposit, please see our website for more information on individual
        programmes deposit options

      </p>
      <p>4. If you book more than one trip at the same time as part of your travel itinerary, you may have to pay more
        than one deposit, depending which trips you choose.

      </p>
      <p>5. You should not book flights or make any travel arrangements in conjunction with your booking until you have
        received confirmation from us. When your space is confirmed you will receive an email accepting your booking and
        we will also send you a second email which will include your log-in details for your personal online account,
        where you can access all of your pre-departure information. At that point a contract will exist between you and
        Real Travelling. Please review the confirmation and let us know if there are any details that need correction,
        for example the spelling of your name etc.

      </p>
      <p>6. If you fail to make a payment on time, either on the payment plan or on the normal plan, we will deem your
        trip cancelled and you will lose the deposit (if you are on the normal plan) or the first and second month's
        payment and deposit (if you are on the payment plan). If you wish to rebook a place back onto your trip, you
        will need to contact us in writing and you will be required to pay a new booking deposit for any trip you choose
        to rebook.

      </p>
      <p>7.If you are booking a trip that departs within 84 days of your departure date, full payment is due with your
        booking to secure your place. If you have booked more than one trip concurrently with us, the full balance on
        all trips is due at the same time as the full payment of your first trip, i.e. 84 days before your departure
        date (the date you depart your home country).

      </p>
      <p>8.If you wish to make date changes to a booking after we have issued your deposit confirmation, you must inform
        us in writing by email. Changes made before we issue your confirmation are free. If you want to make a date
        change to your booking after we have issued a confirmation, provided it is made prior to 84 days before
        departure, there will be an administration fee of £35. If you want to make changes within 84 days of departure
        please contact us in writing to request your change. If it is possible to make the change we will confirm how
        much this will cost. If it is not possible to make the change you have the option to continue with your original
        booking or cancel the trip. In the event that you cancel, cancellation charges will apply, see section 9. If
        your change means that your trip price increases, you will need to pay the difference to us at the time of
        making the change. If your change means that your trip price decreases, we will refund you the difference. If we
        allow you to postpone your booking, you must chose a new start date within one year from the date we postpone
        your trip.

      </p>
      <p>9.If you want to cancel your booking you must do so in writing, by letter or email. Provided your written
        cancellation is received in our office prior to 84 days before departure there will be no cancellation charge
        other than the forfeiture of your deposit. If you paid in full at the time of booking your cancellation fee will
        be equal to the deposit you would have paid under the Normal Payment Plan option. If you are on the payment plan
        you will lose your deposit and your first two monthly instalment payments. If your cancellation notice is
        received in our office within 84 days of departure the following cancellation terms apply:

      </p>
      <p>
      <div style="margin-left:30px;">* Cancellation received 50 - 84 days before departure: you lose 50% of trip cost

        </p>
        <p>* Cancellation received 16 - 49 days before departure: you lose 75% of trip cost

        </p>
        <p>* Cancellation received 0 - 15 days before departure: you lose 100% of trip cost
      </div>
      </p>
      <p>In the event there are unusual extenuating circumstances regarding your cancellation (such as the loss of an
        immediate family member) please write to us explaining the situation and we will do our best to deal fairly with
        you.

      </p>
      <p>10. If you have paid for flights and wish to cancel the flights, you may, or may not, be entitled to a partial
        refund on the cost of flights, depending entirely on the rules applying to the fare type. When you book flights
        it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of the cancellation/refund policy on your ticket. Gap 360
        cannot be held liable for any flight refunds or change fees.

      </p>
      <p>11. If we have to cancel your booking for operational reasons, for example if the minimum number of passengers
        required on the trip does not materialise, we will make a full refund of monies you have paid us for the
        programme, or offer you a suitable alternative trip. Real Travelling cannot be held liable for any flight
        refunds including any costs for changing flights. We will not cancel a trip for minimum numbers reasons within
        28 days of departure. If we have to make a serious change to your trip, and you do not accept the changes, we
        will refund your monies paid to Real Travelling in full. A serious change could be a change in departure date of
        longer than 3 days or a change in trip destination or duration. In the event we make a serious change, which you
        accept, unless the change is necessary because of force majeure we will compensate you as follows:

      </p>
      <p>
      <div style="margin-left:30px;">* Serious change arising less than 15 days before departure: we will pay you £50

        </p>
        <p>* Serious change arising less than 50 days before departure: we will pay you £30

        </p>
        <p>* Serious change arising 84 days or less before departure: we will pay you £15

        </p>
        <p>* Serious change arising more than 84 days before departure: no payment
      </div>
      </p>
      <p>12. Force Majeure. If we have to cancel or make major changes to your programme because of force majeure we
        will not be liable to refund your monies or pay you compensation. We will do our best to offer you an
        alternative trip but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do this. Force Majeure can include, but is not
        limited to, war, the threat of war, civil strife, pandemic, terrorist activities or the threat of terrorist
        activities, acts of governments or local authorities, strikes, industrial disputes, demonstrations, natural
        disasters, unnatural disasters such as explosions or any similar event which is outside our control or the
        control of our suppliers.

      </p>
      <p>As a responsible tour operator, we follow the advice issued by the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).
        If the FCO issues an advisory against all travel to a country that you are booked to travel to with Gap 360, we
        will offer you an alternative trip or a full refund, unless the advisory is issued because of force majeure. If
        the FCO advises against all travel to certain parts of a country that you will be visiting on our programme, we
        will change your trip to avoid that part of the country.

      </p>
      <p>13. We may have to make changes to your trip once your booking is confirmed or once you have departed, for a
        variety of reasons, depending on circumstances. You acknowledge that travel to many of our destinations can
        involve delays and other issues due to the nature of the country or the unsophisticated transportation
        infrastructure. Once you are on your trip we will only make changes for reasons concerning your personal safety
        or convenience, and there will be no refund for any activities or other parts of the trip which you might miss
        as a result of our changes. You acknowledge that travelling through some regions of the world in which we
        operate does involve potential delays and hazards and we cannot be held responsible for cancellations and
        changes that are beyond our control.

      </p>
      <p>14. If you leave your trip before the end for any reason we will not be liable for any refund of the unused
        portion.

      </p>
      <p>15. Once you have paid in full, the price for your trip is guaranteed not to increase. Until you have paid us
        in full however, currency fluctuations, increases in transportation or suppliers costs, or other reasons, may
        mean that the cost of your trip changes. We will absorb the first 2% of any price increase, but we may have to
        increase the price of your trip. If we increase the price by more than 10% you are entitled to cancel and
        receive a full refund. We will not increase the price within 30 days of your departure, and we will not increase
        the price once you have paid us in full.

      </p>
      <p>16. If you book more than 12 months ahead of your programme start date or book a trip as open-dated/unknown
        start date, we cannot guarantee that the price of your trip will not increase. But if you pay for your trip in
        full at time of booking, we will guarantee that you will receive no increase in price with the exception of
        visas.

      </p>
      <p>17. On some trips we provide a "buddy list" with contact details of the other customers on your trip. Unless
        you tell us in writing that you do not wish other customers in your group to have your email address, we will
        include you on the list.

      </p>
      <p>18. Details about your booking, and your invoices and payments all appear electronically online on
        my.realtravelling.com. It is your responsibility to regularly check this webpage for changes, updates and other
        information about your booking. We cannot be held responsible for any problem resulting from you failing to keep
        up-to-date with your booking on your "Real Travelling online account".

        <h1>Data protection: privacy policy</h1>


        <p>RT complies with the General Data Protection Regulations which form part of the UK 2018 Data Protection Act.

        </p>
        <p>In order to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your
          requirements, we need to use the personal information that you provide. We take responsibility for ensuring
          that proper security measures are in place to protect your information.

        </p>
        <p>We must pass your information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines,
          hotels, and transport companies. The information may also be provided to public authorities such as
          customs/immigration if required by them or as required by law.

        </p>
        <p>Controls on data protection may not be as stringent outside the European Economic Area as the legal
          requirement in the UK, or your country of residence. We will only pass information to any person responsible
          for part of your travel arrangements. Where you provide us with personal details, you consent to this
          information being passed on to such organizations, or companies responsible for your travel arrangements. If
          we cannot pass on this information, we cannot provide your travel arrangements.

        </p>
        <p>Gap 360 Ltd complies with relevant data protection requirements and has in place an effective policy for
          protecting your privacy. The policy is available for you to see. The main points are:

        </p>
        <p>
        <div style="margin-left:30px;">1. We will collect and use the personal data you give us fairly and lawfully.
          Your data will include contact information, personal information and preferences, and will be used for us to
          gauge your suitability for the trip you are booking and to help us correctly make arrangements for your trip.
          We will pass on many of the details you give us to the overseas staff and suppliers so that they can properly
          prepare you for your trip.

          </p>
          <p>2. Some of your data could be sensitive, such as your religion or health details. We require this data to
            ensure that your trip preparations can be properly made and you consent to its use.

          </p>
          <p>3. You can request to see all the personal data we hold about you at any time, and we will show you. We
            will explain to you why we need the data and to whom it will be passed.

          </p>
          <p>4. We will amend any data that changes, such as an address change or contact details.

          </p>
          <p>5. You have the right to opt out of future marketing approaches from us but must inform us if you do not
            wish to be contacted.

          </p>
          <p>6.The information you provide to us will only be held for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which
            it is collected.

          </p>
          <p>7.We will not give away or sell your data to any organization other than the ones we deem necessary for the
            proper organization of your trip.

        <h1>Travel Insurance</h1>

        <p>Travelling without insurance is a huge risk. It is a requirement of booking with Real Travelling that you
          will either purchase Real Travelling insurance or you will provide proof of other insurance that you hold.

        </p>
        <p>We recommend that you purchase insurance when you book your trip because you are then covered for trip
          cancellation. You must give us proof that you are insured no later than 30 days before departure. We cannot
          allow uninsured customers to travel with us, so if you do not provide proof of insurance we will cancel your
          trip and the cancellation charges will apply.

        </p>
        <p>It is a requirement of travelling with Real Travelling that whichever insurance policy you choose, it must
          cover you for evacuation and repatriation to a minimum of £500,000.

        </p>
        <p>In the event that you do not book travel insurance with us, and fail to provide us with adequate proof of
          insurance (a policy name, number and details from a recognized insurance provider) before your departure, we
          will regard your trip as cancelled and you will not be eligible for a refund.

        </p>
        <p>It is essential that you understand what risks your policy covers. Some policies do not include deep sea
          diving, bungee jumping, horse riding or extreme sports. Others require you to pay medical services locally and
          claim back when you return to the UK. Still more policies cease if you return to the UK unexpectedly,
          interrupting your trip. It is your responsibility to know what your policy covers. Real Travelling cannot be
          held responsible if you are un-insured for an activity or event despite you believing that your policy covered
          you.

        </p>
        <br>


        <h1>Flights</h1>
        <p>Real Travelling is an agent for CT Travel Group who hold ATOL license 5158. If you book flights with us your
          booking will be handled by Real Flights, part of Gap 360 Ltd, acting as an agent for CT Travel Group. Payment
          for flights will be to CT Travel Group and they will issue the tickets and any relevant ATOL confirmation
          invoices. Your contract for these flights is with the ATOL holder CT Travel Group.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h1>Passport and Visas</h1>
        <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that your passport is up to date and not about to expire. You should have
          at least 6 months left on the passport past the date you plan to return to the UK, as some countries require
          this. We will offer you advice about whether or not you need a visa to enter any country on your trip, but we
          are not responsible for obtaining visas for you. We will provide you with the contact name and numbers of the
          consulate or embassy of the country for which you are required to obtain a visa and it is your responsibility
          to ensure that you receive a visa in your passport prior to travel. We cannot be held liable if the advice we
          have given you is superceded by very recent visa changes instituted by a country's embassy. You may choose to
          use a visa service to obtain visas for you at your own cost. We strongly advise you to regularly check with
          the relevant embassy to ensure that recent changes have not occurred. It is your responsibility to ensure that
          any visa granted to you does not expire while you are in that country, or even before you arrive if you are
          booking many months before travel. No matter where you are headed to, you must ensure that you have the
          correct entry documentation. Some countries require a yellow fever certificate or other inoculation. Your Gap
          360 trip advisor can help you with advice about this, but we cannot be held responsible for any omissions or
          changes that occur. We advise you to review the websites for the embassy or consulate of each country you plan
          to visit for the latest regulations. If you are travelling to or via the USA or Canada, there are special
          electronic travel requirements for all non citizens.

        <p>We are not medically trained and your Real Travelling travel advisor cannot issue advice about whether a trip
          should be booked or not due to medical issues. You are advised to see your GP before you travel and seek their
          advice about inoculations and medicines you might need.

        </p>
        <p>If you suffer from a pre-existing medical condition (including any mental health issues) that may affect your
          ability to participate fully in the trip as described in our information and on the website, you must advise
          us at the time of booking your trip so that we can pass this information on to the trip coordinator overseas.

        </p>
        <p>We may ask for a medical form to be completed by your doctor if you have any medical conditions before we can
          confirm your place on the programme. As such you should not book any flights or make any other travel
          arrangements until you have returned your medical form to Real Travelling and your place has been approved by
          the local team.

        </p>
        <p>Real Travelling must receive the completed medical form back which confirms that you are fit to travel on
          your programme within 3 weeks of the form being sent or 14 weeks before your first trip start date (whichever
          comes first) in order for your trip to be fully confirmed. Real Travelling are not responsible for any fees
          your doctor may charge you for completing the form.

        </p>
        <p>If you fail to return the completed medical form to us within 3 weeks of being sent the form or 14 weeks
          before your first trip start date (whichever comes first), or if you only declare a medical condition to us
          after your booking as been confirmed, we reserve the right to cancel your place on the trip if we have
          concerns about your health and safety on the programme. In this case our standard cancellation terms and
          conditions will apply.

        </p>
        <p>It is your responsibility to take any medicines you may need with you. In the event that you cannot
          participate in any part of the trip because of a medical condition or you fail to disclose a medical condition
          to us whilst on the trip, we will not be able to refund any portion of the trip fee.

        </p>
        <p>At the time of booking, or before you depart for you trip, we will ask you to provide us with the name and
          number of someone who we can contact in case of emergency. We reserve the right to contact this person in the
          event that Real Travelling or a member of the local staff are concerned about your welfare, or the welfare of
          others on your trip due to your actions or behaviour.

        </p>
        <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) provides excellent and up-to-date advice for UK citizens travelling
          abroad.

        <h1>Acceptance of risk</h1>

        <p>If you participate in an activity that is not specifically included in the trip provided by us, you do so at
          your own risk. If you have any complaint or suffer any injury or illness as a result of your participation in
          this activity we cannot be held responsible and your claim should be directed to the local supplier. In the
          event that you do not receive satisfaction, and we believe your claim is valid, we may help you pursue your
          claim, but we cannot be held responsible for any outcome and we may ask you to contribute to our costs in this
          regard.

        </p>
        <p>Our trips operate in a variety of places around the world, some of which may be or may become politically
          unstable, suffer extreme weather, disease or other conditions which could cause you discomfort or even a risk
          to your safety. In booking your trip, you accept that this kind of trip can involve such hazards, and changes
          or disruption to your trip may occur. In the event you do not receive a specific part of your trip because of
          any event or condition beyond our control, we may decide to issue a partial refund for services lost, but we
          are not obliged to do so.

        </p>
        <p>It is not possible for us to be responsible for events or the actions or failures of people and organizations
          over whom we have no control, and no claim can be made against us in this regard. We accept your trip booking
          on the basis that you agree and understand that there may be risks associated with the trip. We cannot be held
          liable or responsible for any delays, accidents, damage, loss, health issues or other issues resulting from
          the failure of people and organisations other than our own staff.

        </p>
        <p>Some trips are entirely operated by third parties. We vet these third parties and arrange trips with them on
          your behalf, but any liability for claims you may wish to make against them lies with the third parties and
          not Real Travelling, although we will help you with claims in the event that we deem your claim fair and
          reasonable.
        </p>
